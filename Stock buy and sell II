The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[] of size n. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day, Find the maximum profit which you can get.

Note: Buying and Selling of the stock can be done multiple times, but you can only hold one stock at a time. In order to buy another stock, firstly you have to sell the current holding stock.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
price[] = {3, 4, 1, 5}
Output:
5
Explanation:
We can buy stock on day 1 (at price 3) and sell it on 
day 2 (at price 4) profit will be 4-3=1, 
We can buy another stock on day 3 (at price 1) and sell 
it on day 4 (at price 5) profit will be 5-1=4, 
which will give us maximum profit of 1+4=5.



def maxProfit(price):
    n = len(price)
    profit = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        # If the current day's price is higher than the previous day, buy and sell the stock
        if price[i] > price[i - 1]:
            profit += price[i] - price[i - 1]

    return profit

# Example usage
price = [3, 4, 1, 5]
result = maxProfit(price)
print(result)
